## Disclaimer

React Schedule Meeting is **still being developed**. Helpful feedback & suggestions are welcome!

## Motivation

We wanted a UI that was agnostic to any actual scheduling logic after the user has selected their slot. The intention is to have an extremely simple component that accepts available time slots and returns a selected time slot.

## Something missing or inaccurate?

If you find issues with the documentation or have suggestions on how to improve the documentation or the project in general, please [file an issue](https://github.com/TylerAHolden/react-schedule-meeting) for us.
